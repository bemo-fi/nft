  "description": "At TON Gateway, we kicked off a spontaneous and fun activity: a sticker wall that turned into a vibrant canvas of signatures, shoutouts, and community vibes. It wasn\u2019t just a wall\u2014it became a moment, a memory, a snapshot of real people building the TON ecosystem together.\n\nTo preserve that moment and share it with the world, we\u2019ve transformed the wall into a unique NFT collection. 'Gateway Wall: Signed by Bemo' captures the energy, creativity, and spirit of the conference\u2014now forever on-chain.",
